# RaphaÃ«l Line Charts Plugin #

## TODO List ##

*   Width (& height) should by default derive from the parent Raphael object.
*   Allow setting popup=false, so that no hover function would be defined, thus
    making the lines1 and lines2 data attributes optional.
*   Allow defining a custom hover function, that I would bind to the rect/circle objects.
*   Test in IE, add "tested browsers" list to docs (so far success with Chrome, FF4, Mobile
    Safari).
*   Allow liquid width/height (how?).
*   Reconsider setting drawGrid and popup as Raphael plugins.
